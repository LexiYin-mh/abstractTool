# Python Virtual Environment

```zsh
conda create --name env_abstract_tool python=3.9
```

1. Package Plan

For example:
`environment location: /Users/lexiyin/opt/anaconda3/envs/env_abstract_tool`

1. activate/deactivate my env
   `$ conda activate env_abscract_tool`
   `$ conda deactivate`

   To check the env list
   `conda env list`

Once you've activated your conda environment, all Python programs you run from the command line will use the Python interpreter in that environment. Similarly, when you install packages with pip or conda, they will be installed in the current active environment.

3. Please be aware of selecting the right Python Interpretor. I am using VS CODE so for me:
   `Cmd+Shift+P` > `Python: Select Interpreter`
